// SUMMARY OF THIS CLASS (CRUD OPERATIONS):
// This class provides 5 methods that cover all basic database operations:
//
// C - CREATE: add() creates a new customer
// R - READ:   getAll() reads all customers, find() reads one specific customer
// U - UPDATE: update() modifies an existing customer
// D - DELETE: delete() removes a customer
//
// These are called "CRUD operations" and are fundamental to almost every database application!
// Think of this class as your customer database toolkit - everything you need to manage customers.
